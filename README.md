# kuai
an old, crappy and dangerous bootlogo changer for jailbroken iOS devices. also,
⚠️️ please do not use this if you don't know what you're doing. please. ⚠️
# why
because i was bored and thought, that this was a cool project
# how do i get it?
```git clone https://github.com/karlgregor/kuai.git``` and ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
# how do i use it?
if you decide to use it (for whatever reason) then:
first of all, create a backup using ```BACKUP.py```
second step, drag your image into the folder
third step, run ```MAIN.py``` and do what it says
fourth step, profit? (when done correctly)
# yo, how do i revert back to the original bootlogo?
make sure you have the ```"original"``` folder, with the original bootlogos, and then just use ```RESTORE.py```
